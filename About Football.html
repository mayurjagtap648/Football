	<h1><center>About Football</center></h1>
	<p><h3>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to 
	score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the 
	most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football 	
	(known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian 
	football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and 
	Gaelic football. These various forms of football are known as football codes.
	There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played 
	in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced 
	back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.
 	The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British 
	influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional 
	codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local 
	traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded 
	in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several 
	of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world. The 
	various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of 
	football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, rugby union and rugby league, 
	where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes 
	such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, 
	and where handling is strictly limited.
	Common rules among the sports include:</h3>
	<h4>-Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.<br>
	-A clearly defined area in which to play the game.<br>
	-Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.<br>
	-Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.<br>
	-The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.<br>
	-Players being required to move the ball—depending on the code—by kicking, carrying, or hand-passing the ball.<br>
	-Players using only their body to move the ball.</h4><br>
	<h3>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". 
	It is widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball") 
	refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative 
	explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games 
	in medieval Europe, which were played on foot. There is no conclusive evidence 
	for either explanation.</h3></p>
