		<h3>Football Players</h3>
		<p>A football player or footballer is a sport person who plays one of the 
		different types of football. The main types of football are
		association football, American football, Canadian football, 
		Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union.
		It has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players 
		in the world,[1] and many play the other forms of football. Jean-Pierre Papin has 
		described football as a "universal language".[2] Footballers across the world and 
		at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players 
		are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture.
		Footballers generally begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become 
		professional players. Normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from 
		there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some learn to 
		play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.Wages in 
		some top men's leagues are significantly higher than other jobs. Players in the Premier 
		League earn average wages of about $1 million per year.[3] In the wealthiest clubs in European 
		football leagues, some players earn an average wage up to $6 to $8 million per year.[4] The best 
		players of those clubs can earn up to $70 million per year.[5]
		However, only a fraction of men's professional football players are paid at this level. 
		Wages may be much more moderate in other divisions and leagues, and a significant number
		[clarification needed] of players are semi-professional. For example, the average annual 
		salary for footballers in Major League Soccer (which started in 2009) for the 2013 season 
		was $148,693, with significant variations depending on player position (goalkeepers for 
		example earned $85,296, whereas forwards earned $251,805[6]).
		Popularity and average salaries in women's leagues are far lower. For example, 
		players in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) (which started in 2012) 
		earn $15,000 to $40,000 per year as of January 2017.[7]</p>
