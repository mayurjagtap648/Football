	<p><h2>The history of football (soccer)</h2>
<h3>Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. 
Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. 
But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.</h3>
<h2>Early history and the precursors of football</h2>
<h3>The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in 
old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. According to the sources, the ball would symbolize 
the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods.The first known ball game which 
also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name Cuju. Cuju was played 
with a round ball on an area of a square. It later spread to Japan and was practiced under ceremonial forms.

Other earlier variety of ball games had been known from Ancient Greece. The ball was made by shreds 
of leather filled with hair (the first documents of balls filled with air are from the 7th century). 
In the Ancient Rome, games with balls were not included in the entertainment on the big arenas, but 
could occur in exercises in the military. It was the Roman culture that would bring football to the 
British island (Britannica). It is, however, uncertain in which degree the British people were influenced 
by this variety and in which degree they had developed their own variants.</h3>
<h2>The game of football takes its form</h2>
<h3>The most admitted story tells that the game was developed in England in the 12th century. 
In this century, games that resembled football were played on meadows and roads in England. 
Besides from kicks, the game involved also punches of the ball with the fist. 
This early form of football was also much more rough and violent than the modern way of playing. 
An important feature of the forerunners to football was that the games involved plenty of people 
and took place over large areas in towns (an equivalent was played in Florence from the 16th century 
where it was called Calcio). The rampage of these games would cause damage on the town and sometimes death. 
These would be among the reasons for the proclamations against the game that finally was forbidden for 
several centuries. But the football-like games would return to the streets of London in the 17th century. 
It would be forbidden again in 1835, but at this stage the game had been established in the public schools.
It took, however, long time until the features of today’s football had been taken into practice. 
For a long time there was no clear distinction between football and rugby. There were also many 
variations concerning the size of the ball, the number of players and the length of a match.

The game was often played in schools and two of the predominant schools were Rugby and Eton. 
At Rugby the rules included the possibility to take up the ball with the hands and the game we 
today know as rugby has its origin from here. At Eton on the other hand the ball was played 
exclusively with the feet and this game can be seen as a close predecessor to the modern football. 
The game in Rugby was called “the running game” while the game in Eton was called “the dribbling game”.</h3></p>
